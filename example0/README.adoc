= Swift/T Minimal Examples

== Installation on JLSE

Setup your environment with:

----
$ PATH=$HOME/Public/sfw/icc/swift-t/stc/bin:$PATH
$ PATH=$HOME/Public/sfw/icc/swift-t/turbine/bin:$PATH
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/soft/compilers/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2017.2.174/linux/compiler/lib/intel64_lin
----

== Hello World

----
$ swift-t -E 'trace("Hello World");'
----

== Leaf function

See here for directions:

http://swift-lang.github.io/swift-t/leaf.html#_complete_example_2_simple_c_function

Amazingly, ICC and GCC work together here.

== State in leaf functions

State can be initialized by setting a Tcl script that is invoked at package load time.  In this case, it is g.tcl .  This initializes a counter to 0.

Any globals in the C code for the leaf function are retained from call to call.  So we can increment the counter as expected.

$ swift-t -r $PWD test-g-n.swift
g: 0+5+1=6
sleeping for 6 seconds...
g: 5+0+2=7
sleeping for 7 seconds...
g: 4+1+3=8
sleeping for 8 seconds...
